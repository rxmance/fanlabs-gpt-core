When we first set out to understand the fan experience, we didn’t expect to become advocates for fandom’s ability to address social issues like loneliness and polarization. But the prevailing discourse around fandom felt incomplete. Based on our own experience, we knew fandom offered something deeper — we just couldn’t yet articulate what.

So we pulled at threads, and eventually saw it clearly: the core of fan engagement is social connection. To be a fan is to be part of a community. That may seem obvious — but its full implications are rarely explored. Like us, most fans take it for granted.

Once we saw the social power of fandom, we couldn’t unsee it. We noticed that most fan activity maps to a seasonal cycle of social engagement. We started using sports more intentionally — sending the game-day text, chatting with strangers in team gear, joining more pools. These weren’t just habits; they were connection rituals that made us happier, more fulfilled, and more socially engaged.

Over time, our journey became something like a religious conversion. Today, we’re not just converts — we’re evangelists. Fandom, when engaged deeply, has a net positive effect on individuals and communities. We believe growing fandom — in depth and reach — has the potential to improve society at large.

At its core, our work is about belonging. Sports are the means; belonging is the end. We are wired for connection, and connection fuels well-being. Happier people build a happier world. That’s why we’re inviting you to embrace your fandom — not just as entertainment, but as a path to real connection.
