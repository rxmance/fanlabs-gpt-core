    "content": "The sports industry didn\u2019t spark a revolution\u2014it capitalized on media fragmentation. As cable and digital platforms splintered audiences, live sports retained their power as appointment-viewing experiences. This scarcity drove up the value of sports content, fueling record-shattering media rights deals and a surge in franchise valuations. In 2025, U.S. media rights payments are projected to hit $29.25 billion, with NFL teams now worth over $6.5 billion on average. Sponsorships and betting revenue have followed, creating a financial windfall rooted in monetizing a once-undervalued but loyal audience."

    "content": "Despite all the financial growth, fandom hasn\u2019t expanded. The number of core sports fans has stayed flat, and the fan replacement rate is slipping. While time spent and revenue per fan have soared, the total number of consistently engaged fans hasn\u2019t. This stagnation poses a long-term risk, especially as acquiring new fans becomes harder and more expensive in an increasingly fragmented media environment."

    "content": "Access barriers are slowing fan growth. Late game times, premium paywalls, and collapsing regional sports networks make it harder for families to build viewing habits. When shared rituals disappear, organic fan acquisition slows. Local fans can\u2019t watch their teams. Kids can\u2019t stay up to watch games with their parents. The monetization strategies that boosted short-term revenue are now limiting long-term growth."

    "content": "Societal shifts are also eroding the conditions that once supported fandom. Phones fragment family moments, even when people are in the same room. Parents are multitasking\u2014fantasy leagues, betting apps, social media\u2014and kids don\u2019t want to join them. Only 19% of younger fans say they watch full games, and even then, most are doing something else. Changing family roles mean sports isn\u2019t a default shared ritual anymore\u2014it has to compete for attention in newly negotiated family dynamics."

    "content": "The industry\u2019s core mistake is framing sports as entertainment. That framing has worked\u2014spectacle sells. But it\u2019s also a trap. Sports isn't Netflix or TikTok. Its greatest asset isn\u2019t production value\u2014it\u2019s belonging. Belonging explains irrational loyalty, deep identity attachment, and behavior that makes no sense through an entertainment lens\u2014like sitting in freezing weather to watch your team lose a meaningless game."

    "content": "Belonging has real economic value. It reduces customer acquisition costs through word-of-mouth and intergenerational transfer. It drives lifetime engagement that continues between seasons. And it unlocks premium pricing via identity economics\u2014people don\u2019t buy a $200 jersey because it\u2019s functional, but because it signals membership in a tribe. The Green Bay Packers\u2019 community ownership model is the most extreme example: $65 million raised for stock with no financial return\u2014only belonging."

    "content": "The old system of organic fan growth is gone. Sports fandom used to pass down naturally\u2014from parent to child, neighborhoods to neighbors. But the infrastructure that supported this has changed. To sustain growth, the industry must intentionally invest in rebuilding the belonging infrastructure\u2014rituals, traditions, and touchpoints that create community, not just content consumption."

    "content": "The industry\u2019s current efforts to reach young fans are based on a misunderstanding. Viral clips and TikTok strategies might grab attention, but they don\u2019t build identity. True fandom develops before age 14 through repeated, shared experiences. Kids don\u2019t become fans from apps\u2014they become fans from rituals: watching with family, going to games, learning team history. In short: fandom isn\u2019t downloaded\u2014it\u2019s inherited."
